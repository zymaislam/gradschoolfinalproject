PROJECT RECONNECT
Zyma Islam, Howard Zhang, Mark Rivett-Carnac, and Emilie Xie
	 
OVERVIEW 
The program we are investigating is called “Project Reconnect,” and it is overseen by the Department of Homeless Services—a city department, not state or federal (this is an important distinction when looking at funding). Project Reconnect has been in place in one form or another since Ed Koch’s tenure as mayor, albeit by different names. 

Homelessness spiked under Mayor Bloomberg’s administration. While serving as city public advocate, Mayor de Blasio championed homelessness issues. How effective has he been?
 
The significance of the story lies in the fact that it is a contentious issue. Buying one-way tickets for homeless people pushed New York City’s homeless population into other cities, but also is also cheaper alternative to shelters and can help reconnect families. 

The stakeholders are the ones being directly benefiting or not benefiting from the program i.e. the homeless population, the policy makers, the homeless shelters, as well as the average New Yorker as people living in New York will come into contact with the homeless population one way or another.

COMPETITIVE COVERAGE
While there was broad news coverage of this program in 2009, in the last few years most major papers— including the New York Times, the New Yorker, the New York Post and Daily News—have not covered the program we are investigating, “Project Reconnect”. The only break in the silence was a 2014 article in the Post. (Articles can be found here, and here).
 
Their angles have included brief mentions of individual cases of the homeless people being relocated, how much the individual trips cost and the number of people who used Project Reconnect under de Blasio compared to Michael Bloomberg. 

With such scant coverage, we believe more can be said on the project. And certainly the data could be much more comprehensive. More specifically, we will investigate the program’s cost compared to alternative homeless programs, destination trends, the process of securing a ticket, and historical trend in similar initiatives within and outside of New York City.

TARGET PUBLICATION
Our intended audience is New Yorkers with an interest in public policy and social issues. The target publication is The Upshot for the New York Times.
 


STORY AND CLOSE/MIDDLE/REACH PITCHES 
 
1. Historical perspective of Project Reconnect. How does it compare to past initiatives in New York City and similar projects in other cities and states? (Howard)

Homelessness has plagued New York City for decades. Although there are many services dedicated to serving the unfortunates, the effects and efforts are far from satisfactory. As homeless population reached all time high this year, it is high time for NYC authorities to act. Now, a program has regained the spotlight to solve NYC’s homeless problem once and for all: relocating homeless to other cities.

Project Reconnect is a government-funded program designed to send homeless people back to their hometown. The decision is voluntary and the NYC government will provide the bus, train, or even plane tickets to move homeless to anywhere but here. However, despite the controversial approach, this program has not been discussed much in recent years. 

My story will primarily focus on the background of NYC’s homeless issues and the significance of Project Reconnect. I will look into the history, rational, legitimacy and practically of this relocation program. My interviewees will consist primarily of experts (history and social), government officials, and lawyers. My data visualization will illustrate the current homeless situation in NYC and how Project Reconnect can make it better (or worse). 

Have-to-have: The basic background of NYC homeless issues. Have experts discuss the history and impact of Project Reconnect on homeless issue. What makes Project Reconnect different than past initiatives. Data on the total number of people Project Reconnect helped is crucial. One illustration should be comparing the overall homeless population in NYC to the number of people who accepted the program. Another illustration should be the demographic breakdown of people relocated by the program. 

Nice-to-have: Details and procedures of homeless relocation programs in other cities; a comparative study on what are NYC’s advantages and disadvantages in executing homeless relocation programs. Interviewing retired government officials and lawyers can be helpful. A chart showing the number of homeless being relocated across US is appreciated. 

Great-to-have: Interview lawyers to discuss the legitimacy of this relocation program. Explore the historical trends of homeless relocation programs. 


2. Comparing the cost of sending people away and running homeless shelter. What is the overall economics of Project Reconnect? (Zyma)

The U.S. department of housing and urban development secretary Shaun Donovan told The Daily Show that the cost of a homeless person per year is $40,000. (http://bit.ly/1Bci5Oq). Analyzing the current shelter statistics, the Independent Budget Office estimated that adult shelter costs will reach $366 million by the end of 2015, which nearly $10 million more (all city funds) than the city has budgeted. They also projected that the costs would reach $356 million in 2016, $19 million more than the city’s current projection (http://bit.ly/1IgeFvd). 

Last November DNAInfo (http://dnain.fo/1xP7OFb) reported that the government temporarily rented out a hundred rooms in a hotel by Radisson to temporarily house the homeless. According to the website, rooms at the luxury hotel cost $175 upwards for a night. That would put the per night cost at $17,500 and food was an extra. 

While the JFK Radisson hotel reportedly was not a permanent solution, many hotels/inns/rest-houses are currently relying mostly on the DHS for providing them with customers, hence giving rise to the term “for-profit-shelter”. According to the State of Homeless report published by Coalition for the Homeless last year 51 percent of the homeless were housed in such shelters. The city spent more than $1 billion on homeless shelter and services in 2013. This was a five percent increase over the previous year. The report also said that the average cost to shelter a homeless family each year was $37,603 in 2013, and that this too was a two percent rise. 

Have to have: Using the data accumulated by this organization and from NYC Opendata, we can build a dataset of exactly how much the city spent over the last couple of years on providing services to the homeless. We must adjust the data for inflation. This has to take into account not only housing, but services and special disability services and spans across several datasets like  http://bit.ly/1BJL8Gh, http://bit.ly/1ytg645  and http://bit.ly/1xtF3kV. 

Also have to have: Data on how much exactly is the city spending on the tickets

The resulting visualization will then be a comparison. 

Great to have: http://bit.ly/1ErAhXD This is a list of 139 for profit shelters used by DHS. It would be wonderful if you could ask how much each costs per night and do a chart. A lot of backbreaking reporting. 

Nice to have: The most recent quote of cost provided by the DHS

3. Process (Emilie)
This story will focus on who is qualified for Project Reconnect, how they are vetted and the steps taken for an individual to use the program and return home. The story angle would fit into the broad overarching theme of Project Reconnect while focusing on the process, as well as what the individuals think about the process and how they learned about this option? 

For the process, the information will most likely come from former city officials. For the individuals, we will reach out to shelters and nonprofits to find people to talk to. I think it would easier to find homeless individuals on the street to ask if they know about Project Reconnect.

Have-to-have: Someone to tell me about the process of applying, most likely will come from a former government official, hopefully will come from Sam Dodge who coordinated Project Reconnect back in 2008. Then, translating that process into a visualization (most likely a diagram) of the steps to take to get a one way plane ticket or bus ticket. Also, members of the homeless population who will tell me if they have heard of Project Reconnect, and their thoughts on it. 

Nice-to-have: A face for the story, a homeless individual who is in the middle of applying for Project Reconnect, he or she would be able to speak about the level of difficulty in obtaining an one way ticket out of New York, and how he or she is benefitting from the program. Also, the visualization of the process would be animated, the animation should be something that is visually appealing, like flashing arrows, but also adds to the story.

Great-to-have: Google Analytics to track user activity on our website, and social media buttons that enable sharing of the article, as well as links to our social media accounts.



4. Destinations (Mark)
In this section of our story we will analyze destination trends of Project Reconnect. We want to see if certain locations are picked more frequently than others. And if so, why? 

According to data from 2009 New York Time’s article, Puerto Rico was the most popular destination outside of the continental states, while Florida was the favorite within the continental states. Studying destinations trends since 2009 will reveal a great deal about who Project Reconnect is serving, and who it might be missing. It would be particularly interesting to map destination trends against homeless population demographics. 

The best source of destination data will be in the city’s Project Reconnect records. Past articles suggest that the destinations of all purchased tickets is be logged. Retrieving this data might be difficult. To help speed the process along, we will talk to past journalists and advocates who have studied the program. They might know who else keeps records and have an insights into why certain trends appear in the data.

Have-to-have: A basic breakdown of where people are heading. The simplest visualization for this information is a map with markers indicating the number of people who chose each destination. We can use the mapping programs we studied in class for this visualization.

Nice-to-have: Like the have-to-have visualization, but with more engaging style and animation. Instead of circles to locate destinations, this visualization will lines that start in NYC and end at the destination. Each line’s thickness will represent magnitude of the population heading to the destination. As an added feature, hovering over the line will provide more information about the population heading to that destination and maybe include a story from someone who chose this destination.


Great-to-have: Like the nice-to-have visualization, but with added data that compares the popularity of a Project Reconnect destination with demographic information from NYC’s homeless population. For example, maybe Florida is the favorite destination of people using Project Reconnect, but only a small portion of homeless people in NYC come from Florida. To keep the visualization clean and clear, this comparative information would only appear on the map only when the user hovers over a destination.

Mandel is the lead attorney for its Housing Project which combats homelessness and is located in Queens.
They do a lot of field work.
While the Housing Project probably does not deal with Project Reconnect directly, I’ve had good experiences talking with NYLAG people. It helps if you mention a specific NYLAG case when you talk with them to show you did your homework. 
If you can’t get through to them, I know a lady who works there who owes me a favor.
