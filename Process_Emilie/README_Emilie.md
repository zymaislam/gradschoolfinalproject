INTRO:

This story will focus on who is qualified for Project Reconnect, how they are vetted and the steps taken for an individual to use the program and return home. The story angle would fit into the broad overarching theme of Project Reconnect while focusing on the process, as well as what the individuals think about the process and how they learned about this option? 

For the process, the information will most likely come from former city officials. For the individuals, we will reach out to shelters and nonprofits to find people to talk to. I think it would easier to find homeless individuals on the street to ask if they know about Project Reconnect.

PITCH:
Close

Have-to-have: Someone to tell me about the process of applying, most likely will come from a former government official, hopefully will come from Sam Dodge who coordinated Project Reconnect back in 2008. Then, translating that process into a visualization (most likely a diagram) of the steps to take to get a one way plane ticket or bus ticket. Also, members of the homeless population who will tell me if they have heard of Project Reconnect, and their thoughts on it.

Middle

Nice-to-have: A face for the story, a homeless individual who is in the middle of applying for Project Reconnect, he or she would be able to speak about the level of difficulty in obtaining an one way ticket out of New York, and how he or she is benefitting from the program. If we can find a face for the story, it would be great to incorporate the individualâ€™s printed quotes to the visualization.

Reach

Great-to-have: Google Analytics to track user activity on our website, and social media buttons that enable sharing of the article, as well as links to our social media accounts.

Mobile option: Would make it possible to zoom in and enlarge the visualization, however the printed quotes from the nice to have scenario might be taken out.
