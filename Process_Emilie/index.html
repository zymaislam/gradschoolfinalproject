						The process of obtaining a one-way plane or bus ticket varies slightly from city to city, but as long as homeless individuals can prove they have a place to stay at their intended destinations, the State of New York rarely refuses to purchase tickets, according to the Department of Homeless Services.
					</p>
					<p>
						The process a homeless individual would have to go through in order to obtain one of these one-way tickets is relatively straight-forward, said Sam Dodge, who previously worked as Associate Staff Analyst at the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) from 2008 to 2013. &quot;Basically, anywhere in the system, whether they were on the street or in the shelter or taken in at a drop-in center, if someone expressed that they have family or friends that were willing to accept them, we could work with them to get tickets to wherever that family, or support system, or friendship was,&quot; Dodge said.
					</p>
					<p>
						According to Gabriela Sandoval Requena, a Policy Analyst for the nonprofit Coalition for the Homeless, the homeless individual would first fill an intake form, providing the contact information of friends or family willing and able to take the person in. Then the DHS would contact that them to confirm that they understood the situation and were ready to accept the homeless person in New York, and that they had the ability and necessary resources to help that person. Once it&rsquo;s confirmed, the process of arranging to buy a ticket can be completed within a few days. &quot;It all really depends on the cross-checking process,&quot; Requena said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then after the individual arrives in their requested location, the DHS will place a call to make sure they arrived safely, and then a few more in the coming months.
					</p>
					<p>
						The DHS often collaborates with travel agency Austin Travels to book tickets for domestic one-way trips.
					</p>
					<p>
						Other states have also implemented this program, as it makes economic-sense, the cost of a ticket is much cheaper than the cost of housing a homeless individual in a city-run shelter. In San Francisco, the program is commonly known as Homeward Bound, and the process is slightly different from New York&rsquo;s.
					</p>
					<p>
						&quot;The program in San Francisco is a once-in-a-lifetime program,&quot; Dodge said, who is currently the Deputy Director For Policy for the Mayor's Office of Housing Opportunity, Partnership and Engagement in San Francisco. &quot;When you use it, you forgo your rights to access the welfare system again, if you were to come back. And they have follow up calls one a month for six months, and over the last 8-9 years, they have revamped the system, and have connected almost 9000 families, and we&rsquo;ve have had 25 people come back through the shelter system. We have a finger scanning so we know if someone&rsquo;s in the system or not. And unlike in New York, in San Francisco we just do bus tickets.&quot;

					</p>
					<p>
						Individuals often hear about the program through word of mouth, or through the homeless outreach programs, and when they arrive at shelters, where they will be informed of their options, which includes Project Reconnect. &quot;Project Reconnect is a program on its own implemented during the intake of homeless people,&quot; said Devon Brown, a PR officer at DHS.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sam Carlton, 45, a homeless individual, said he has been in and out of many different shelters for years, including the St. Anthony Shelter up in the Bronx, and has never been told of Project Reconnect. However, he speculated that perhaps as a native New Yorker, the shelters saw no reason to tell him. &quot;If I had known, I&rsquo;d probably just use it as an opportunity for a free vacation!&quot; he said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Carlton spends many days sitting outside of delis on Amsterdam Avenue, and stays at a shelter, but did not wish to reveal the shelter&rsquo;s name.
					</p>
					<p>
						Kevin Taylor, 27, is a homeless individual who said he has been through the Project Reconnect process. According to Taylor, he was originally from Montana, but ran away at 17 years old to come to New York. After staying in New York for several years, he had used Project Reconnect to obtain a bus ticket back to Montana, but eventually returned to New York. Now he spends his days on the N train, travelling from Times Square to Union Square, asking for money for a bus ticket back to Montana, because he couldn&rsquo;t use Project Reconnect again.</p>
					<p>
						&quot;The places I went to for help said that the project is only for people under the age of 24,&quot; Taylor said, but refused to divulged the names of the shelters.
					</p>
					<p>
						A bus ticket to Montana is worth $97 dollars, &quot;I have 60 dollars so far and need $37 more,&quot; he said.
