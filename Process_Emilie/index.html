				The process of obtaining a one-way plane or bus ticket varies slightly from city to city, but as long as homeless individuals can prove they have a place to stay at their intended destinations, the State of New York rarely refuses to purchase tickets, according to the Department of Homeless Services.
			</div>

			<div class="bodyCopy" id="para2">
				The process a homeless individual would have to go through in order to obtain one of these one-way tickets is relatively straight-forward, said Sam Dodge, who previously worked as Associate Staff Analyst at the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) from 2008 to 2013. “Basically, anywhere in the system, whether they were on the street or in the shelter or taken in at a drop-in center, if someone expressed that they have family or friends that were willing to accept them, we could work with them to get tickets to wherever that family, or support system, or friendship was,” Dodge said.
			</div>

			<div class="bodyCopy" id="para3">
				According to Gabriela Sandoval Requena, a Policy Analyst for the nonprofit Coalition for the Homeless, the homeless individual would first fill an intake form, providing the contact information of friends or family willing and able to take the person in. Then the DHS would contact that them to confirm that they understood the situation and were ready to accept the homeless person in New York, and that they had the ability and necessary resources to help that person. Once it’s confirmed, the process of arranging to buy a ticket can be completed within a few days. “It all really depends on the cross-checking process,” Requena said.

			<div class="bodyCopy" id="para4">
				Then after the individual arrives in their requested location, the DHS will place a call to make sure they arrived safely, and then a few more in the coming months.
			</div>

			<div class="bodyCopy" id="para5">
				The DHS often collaborates with travel agency Austin Travels to book tickets for domestic one-way trips.
			</div>

			<div class="bodyCopy" id="para6">
				Other states have also implemented this program, as it makes economic-sense, the cost of a ticket is much cheaper than the cost of housing a homeless individual in a city-run shelter. In San Francisco, the program is commonly known as Homeward Bound, and the process is slightly different from New York’s.
			</div>

			<div class="bodyCopy" id="para7">
				“The program in San Francisco is a once-in-a-lifetime program,” Dodge said, who is currently the Deputy Director For Policy for the Mayor's Office of Housing Opportunity, Partnership and Engagement in San Francisco. “When you use it, you forgo your rights to access the welfare system again, if you were to come back. And they have follow up calls one a month for six months, and over the last 8-9 years, they have revamped the system, and have connected almost 9000 families, and we’ve have had 25 people come back through the shelter system. We have a finger scanning so we know if someone’s in the system or not. And unlike in New York in San Francisco, we just do bus tickets.”
			</div>

			<div class="bodyCopy" id="para8">
				Individuals often hear about the program through word of mouth, or through the homeless outreach programs, and when they arrive at shelters.
			</div>

			<div class="bodyCopy" id="para9">
				According to the New York Post, in 2013 under the Bloomberg administration, the city's Department of Homeless Services bought plane or bus tickets for 2,208 people and cost it cost $500,000, with homeless individuals being sent as far as Paris and South Africa.
			</div>

			<div class="bodyCopy" id="para10">
				Mayor de Blasio has sent 1,412 homeless people packing between January and September last year, the official cost for this year hasn’t been released yet.
