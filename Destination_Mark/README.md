INTRO:

In this section of our story we will analyze destination trends of Project Reconnect. 
We want to see if certain locations are picked more frequently than others. And if so, why? 

According to data from 2009 New York Time’s article, Puerto Rico was the most popular destination outside 
of the continental states, while Florida was the favorite within the continental states. Studying destinations 
trends since 2009 will reveal a great deal about who Project Reconnect is serving, and who it might be missing. 
It would be particularly interesting to map destination trends against homeless population demographics. 

The best source of destination data will be in the city’s Project Reconnect records. Past articles suggest 
that the destinations of all purchased tickets is be logged. Retrieving this data might be difficult. 
To help speed the process along, we will talk to past journalists and advocates who have studied the program. 
They might know who else keeps records and have an insights into why certain trends appear in the data.

CLOSE-MIDDLE-REACH:

![Here is a drawing of my have-, nice-, great-to-have visualizations.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataVisualizationCUJ/ProjectReconnect/master/Destination_Mark/IMAGES/destination_paperVisualization.JPG?token=AKQDY1IwBUOLyjNgqmlxsuZSXcmOrYQOks5VMAYmwA%3D%3D)

Have-to-have: 
A basic breakdown of where people are heading. The simplest visualization for this information is a map with circular 
markers indicating the number of people who chose each destination. We can use the mapping programs we studied in class 
for this visualization.

Nice-to-have: 
Like the have-to-have visualization, but with more engaging information. Hovering over the circle will provide more 
information about the population heading to that destination. For example, quotes from experts and stories from 
participants can appear in pop up windows. This will help flesh out the story. 

For small screens, hovering will not work. So we will have to use a tap feature. Tap a circle and the pop-up window will 
appear. Tap again, and it disappears.

Great-to-have: 
Like the nice-to-have visualization, but with added data that compares the popularity of a Project Reconnect destination
with demographic information from NYC’s homeless population. For example, maybe Florida is the favorite destination 
of people using Project Reconnect, but only a small portion of homeless people in NYC come from Florida. We will use a second
cirlce within the original ciricle to embed this information into the visualization. This will also help keep the 
visualization compatiable with small screens.
