ROUGH:

<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio and Michael Bloomberg agree on at least one policy: buying one-way, out-of-town tickets for homeless people in New York City.

<p>Reintroduced under Bloomberg and embraced by De Blasio, Project Reconnect is a Department of Homeless Services’ program that provides bus, train or plane tickets for anyone in shelters who wants to leave the city. Participants have to prove they have a potential address and support system outside New York City. So long as these criteria are met, no destination is out of reach.</p> 

<p>The program’s stated mission is, “Bringing families together.” Comparing destination trends with the demographics of homeless population largely (TK supports/contradicts) this message.</p>

<p>Since 2007, the city has bought tickets to Paris and Johannesburg, while the most popular destinations were Florida and Puerto Rico. (TK updated data from DHS for a three paragraph breakdown of recent and historical destination trends. I just received 2007-2011 data rom Howard, but have requested 2011-2015 from the DHS press office and FOIL office.)</p>

<p>Few who arrive at the homeless shelters are from outside New York City—only about 10 percent of families with children 20 percent of adult families, according to recent data from the DHS. But of this population, most listed former addresses in New Jersey, Florida and Pennsylvania, according to a 2013 study by the New York Times. (TK updated former address records kept by the Department of Homeless for a one paragraph analysis.)</p>

<p>Homeless advocate, (TK interview with Luis Tejada, Arnold Cohen, Seth Diamond or Liz Hit, depending on who responds to my multiple calls) said the issue is, (TK two to three quotes about destination trends.)</p> 

<p>But a member of de Blasio’s office (TK interview with de Blasio’s counsel Ian Bassin or de Blasio press contact Maibe Ponte) said the program, (TK two to three quotes about destination trends.)</p>

<p>Outside of the mayor’s office and legal boardrooms, people's appreciation for the program is somewhat different. (TK story of a participant or someone who wants to be a participant.)</p>

<p>Experts might not need to debate whether Project Reconnect removes homeless people from the city or reconnects them with family—the program looks like it will disappear on its own. Between 2009 and 2015, its budget dropped by 90 percent. What’s more, this drop occurred during the same period that the homeless population exploded from just under 40,000 to over 60,000.</p> 

<p>Facing such staggering demand for housing, looking outside of the city (TK kicker quote).</p>
