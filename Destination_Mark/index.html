  	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para1">
  		Homeless individuals who use Project Reconnect to escape New York City have clear preferences among the fifty states. Florida is, without question, the most popular destination. Georgia ranks high, too. But no one has found a reason to move to the Dakotas, Idaho or Wyoming.
  	</div>
  	
	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para2">
		Project Reconnect, overseen by the Department of Homeless Services, provides bus, train or plane tickets for anyone in shelters who wants to leave the city. Participants have to prove they have a potential address and support system outside New York City. So long as these criteria are met, no destination is out of reach.
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para3">
		While domestic destinations make up about 76 percent of the trips, the city has paid for tickets abroad. Families and couples have used the program to reconnect with family in Japan, Morocco, Peru, India, the West Indies, the Ukraine and Russia. But these far-flung destinations are rare. Much more common is Puerto Rico, which receives 20 percent of all Project Reconnect participants.
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para4">
		Although Project Reconnect's slogan claims the program "brings families together," homeless individuals are not necessarily returning to their hometowns or relatives.
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para5">
		About 10 percent of families with children and 20 percent of adult families who arrive at homeless shelters are from outside New York City, according to recent data from the DHS. Of this population, most listed former addresses in New Jersey, Florida and Pennsylvania, according to a 2013 study by the New York Times. But Project Reconnect bought only one ticket to New Jersey between 2007 and 2011. And Pennsylvania was the seventh most popular state.
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para6">
		Moreover, Florida receives twice as many participants as the next most popular destination and more than ten times the average.
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para7">
		"Clients using this program to travel to Florida does not necessarily mean that most of the out-of-state individuals and families in shelter are from there," said Gabriela Sandoval Requena, a policy analyst at the Coalition for the Homeless.
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para8">
		"It is important to note that the list of destinations is a not a list of the places of origin," she said. "Establishing a correlation between these two would be premature and unsubstantiated."
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para9">
		Shelters in Florida welcome individuals from all over the country, said Musset Robinson, the director of communications for Coalition for the Homeless of Central Florida.
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para10">
		She said she hoped Project Reconnect was not a program where "one city is relocating homeless citizens to another city, which already has homeless individuals."
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para11">
		"We would hope cities would deal with homelessness without relocating the issue," she said.
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para12">
		But she did not disregard the program.
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para13">
		"If someone has a someone to say with and a potential job and food," she said, "that's fine."
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyCopy" id="para14">
		"It's warm here," she said. "There's no snow and ice."
