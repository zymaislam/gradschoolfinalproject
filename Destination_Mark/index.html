			Homeless individuals who use Project Reconnect to escape New York City have clear preferences among the fifty states. Florida is, without question, the most popular destination. Georgia ranks high, too. But no one has found a reason to move to the Dakotas, Idaho or Wyoming.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para2">
			Project Reconnect, overseen by the Department of Homeless Services, provides bus, train or plane tickets for anyone in shelters who wants to leave the city. Participants have to prove they have a potential address and support system outside New York City. So long as these criteria are met, no destination is out of reach.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para3">
			While domestic destinations make up about 76 percent of the trips, the city has paid for tickets abroad. Families and couples have used the program to travel to Japan, Morocco, Peru, India, the West Indies, the Ukraine and Russia. But these far-flung destinations are rare. Much more common is Puerto Rico, which receives 20 percent of all Project Reconnect participants.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para4">
			Although Project Reconnect's slogan claims the program "brings families together," homeless individuals are not necessarily returning to their hometowns or relatives.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para5">
			About 10 percent of families with children and 20 percent of adult families who arrive at homeless shelters are from outside New York City, according to recent data from the DHS. Of this population, most listed former addresses in New Jersey, Florida and Pennsylvania, according to a 2013 study by the New York Times. But Project Reconnect bought only one ticket to New Jersey between 2007 and 2011. Pennsylvania was the seventh most popular state. And Florida received twice as many participants as the next most popular destination and more than ten times the average.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para6">
			"Clients using this program to travel to Florida does not necessarily mean that most of the out-of-state individuals and families in shelter are from there," said Gabriela Sandoval Requena, a policy analyst at the Coalition for the Homeless.	
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para7">
			"It is important to note that the list of destinations is a not a list of the places of origin," she said. "Establishing a correlation between these two would be premature and unsubstantiated."
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para8">

			Brent Trotter, the president and CEO of the Coalition for the Homeless of Central Florida, has a theory on why people move south.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para10">	
			"Why wouldn't you want to live in florida?" he asked. "Our license plates say endless summer."
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para11">	
			But he was careful to point out that life in Florida is not necessarily the paradise as seen on TVâ€”housing is not in abundance.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para12">	
			"We are about at 95% occupancy rate of our apartment inventory," Trotter said. 
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para13">	
			Jobs are equally insecure.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para14">	
			"We've seen people who have come, particularly to orlando, to pursue a promised job or interview that sounds promising," he said. "But when they actually make their way here their job is no longer available."
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para15">	
			For these reason, Trotter said, it is all the more important to ensure homeless people from New York City are heading towards a supportive environment. But, he said, he has never been contacted about Project Reconnect by any New York City official. This could lead to a problem. As Trotter explained, residents can use the address of the shelter run buy the Coalition for Homeless of Central Florida as their own. That means the shelter could be used as a destination for Project Reconnect volunteers without it registering as emergency housing. 
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para16">	
			"If that's not verified on that end," he said referring to New York City, "then it is certainly not verified on this end."
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para17">	
			Trotter was far from dismissive about the program.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para18">	
			"Any effort to reunify a family is certainly commendable," he said, "but relocation for the sake of getting rid of a nuisance we do not endorse."
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyCopy" id="para19">	
			Reconnecting and relocating, he said, are separated by a very fine line.
