				Homeless individuals who use Project Reconnect to escape New York City have clear preferences among the fifty states. Florida is, without question, the most popular destination. Georgia ranks high, too. But no one has found a reason to move to the Dakotas, Idaho or Wyoming.
				</p><p>
				Project Reconnect, overseen by the Department of Homeless Services, provides bus, train or plane tickets for anyone in shelters who wants to leave the city. Participants have to prove they have a potential address and support system outside New York City. So long as these criteria are met, no destination is out of reach.
				</p><p>
				While domestic destinations make up about three-quarters of the trips from 2007 to 2011, the city has paid for tickets abroad. Families and couples have used the program to travel to Japan, Morocco, Peru, India, the West Indies, the Ukraine and Russia. These far-flung destinations are rare. Much more common is Puerto Rico, which received 290 travelers between 2007 and 2011.
				</p><p>
				Although the program's slogan claims that it "brings families together," homeless individuals are not necessarily returning to their hometowns. Three-quarter of Project Reconnect participants listed a prior address in New York City. Only four percent of participants identified an address in Florida, but the state received 14 percent of travelers, according to 2014 data from a deputy press secretary at the DHS. 
				</p><p>
				This mismatch appears with other states, too. The top five places of origin for out-of-town homeless in shelters were New York State, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and North Carolina, said the DHS press person. But Project Reconnect bought only one ticket to New Jersey between 2007 and 2011. And just 42 people headed to Pennsylvania during the same period, making it the seventh most popular destination.
				</p><p>
				The DHS did not respond email requests for additional comments. Representatives at the DHS intake center at 400 East 30th Street could not be reached, either.  
				</p><p>
				But Gabriela Sandoval Requena, a policy analyst at the Coalition for the Homeless, said the discrepancies between destinations and prior addresses were not unreasonable.
				</p><p>
				"It is important to note that the list of destinations is a not a list of the places of origin," she said. "Establishing a correlation between these two would be premature and unsubstantiated."
				</p><p>
				"Clients using this program to travel to Florida does not necessarily mean that most of the out-of-state individuals and families in shelter are from there," said said.
				</p><p>
				Homeless shelters and care providers outside of the DHS network have little contact with the program.  
				</p><p>
				At the New York City Rescue Mission, on 90 Lafayette Street, intake coordinator Martin Bowman said he was familiar with Project Reconnect but that his organization did not use the program. Participants, he said, have to be registered with one of the city's shelters. "This way it can be cost saving," he said. 
				</p><p>
				Two social workers at The Bowery Mission had not even heard of Project Reconnect. They both asked to remain anonymous because their organization does now allow employees to speak with the press.
				</p><p>
				While New Yorkers were unwilling or unable to discuss why homeless people overwhelmingly choose southern destinations, Brent Trotter, the president and CEO of the Coalition for the Homeless of Central Florida, offered a definitive theory.
				</p><p>
				"Why wouldn't you want to live in Florida?" he asked, explaining how some of the state's license plates say "endless summer."
				</p><p>
				But he was careful to point out that life in Florida does not live up to the paradise seen on TV.
				</p><p>
				"We are about at 95 percent occupancy rate of our apartment inventory," Trotter said. 
				</p><p>
				Jobs are equally insecure.
				</p><p>
				"We've seen people who have come, particularly to Orlando, to pursue a promised job or interview that sounds promising," he said. "But when they actually make their way here their job is no longer available."
				</p><p>
				For these reason, Trotter said, it is all the more important to ensure homeless people from New York City are heading towards a supportive environment. But, he said, he has never been contacted about Project Reconnect by any New York City official. This could lead to a problem.
				</p><p>
				As Trotter explained, residents can use the address of the shelter run buy the Coalition for Homeless of Central Florida as their own. That means the shelter could be used as a destination for Project Reconnect volunteers without it registering as emergency housing. And he said that as far as he knows, no one from either city is checking if Project Reconnect travelers are ending up in Florida's shelters.
				</p><p>
				But Trotter was far from dismissive about the program.
				</p><p>
				"Any effort to reunify a family is certainly commendable," he said, "but relocation for the sake of getting rid of a nuisance we do not endorse."
				</p><p>
				Reconnecting and relocating, he said, are separated by a very fine line.
