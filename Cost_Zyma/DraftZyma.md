Where is the money for Project Reconnect coming from?

“Project Reconnect,” is overseen by the NYC Department of Homeless Services and aims to reinstate homeless shelter residents with family and friends outside of New York by buying them one-way bus tickets to go back home.

Project Reconnect has been in place in one form or another since Ed Koch’s tenure as mayor, albeit by different names.

In the fiscal year of 2014, the city department spent fifty-thousand dollars in buying bus tickets for such purposes, according to the preliminary budget hearing document (http://council.nyc.gov/downloads/pdf/budget/2014/). Listed under “Other adjustments” the budget states that the money was not sourced in from city funds, meaning it came from the state fund under the allocation for Homeless Housing and Assistance Program. A list of the different sources from which the DHS gets funds can be found in this dataset provided by the Department of City Planning (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Summary-Table-Of-Funding-Sources/i7jz-e2db).

TK: Confirm with a department official whether I have cross-matched the source correctly

However the document of the preliminary budget hearing of 2015 shows that there is no money allocated for Project Reconnect (http://council.nyc.gov/downloads/pdf/budget/2015/).

TK: A quote about why the project was not in the proposal

According to data filtered from a budget dataset provided by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), it can be seen that spending on homeless has been an uphill trend (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Budget-Expense-All-Funds/fseq-viud). In fiscal year 2015, the planned budget requested by the Department of Homeless Services was $423 million.

TK: cross check the budgets labelled as “plan” which what was actually doled out and update graph.

This is inclusive of running homeless drop-in centers, paying for cluster shelters used to house the homeless, temporary housing facilities, homeless outreach programs, homelessness prevention programs, and programs geared towards employment. This does not include disability services but does take into accord substance abuse and mental health projects. In order to make sure of what are the constituents of the budget I checked with their audit records which can be accessed (http://www.nyc.gov/html/hra/downloads/pdf/contracts/audit_protocols/audits_2013/june_2013/Audit_Guide_DHS.pdf).

TK: confirm with an official whether the programs listed above are indeed the only ones taking money from DHS or find a better dataset to confirm the fact.

In such a scenario, the money allocated for Project Reconnect last year could have saved precious dollars this time around as well. The U.S. department of housing and urban development secretary Shaun Donovan told The Daily Show that the cost of a homeless person per year is $40,000. (http://bit.ly/1Bci5Oq).
In FY 2014, the average annual cost of sheltering a homeless family was $37,047 and the average annual cost of sheltering a homeless single adult was $28,609 as stated by a report by the Coalition for the Homeless (http://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SOTH2015.pdf). TK: they used NYC Office of Management and Budget as a source. I need to find the dataset. One reason why taking care of the homeless has risen so sharply is because of the increase in the use of cluster shelters – a residual effect of Bloomberg's policies as stated by the report by the Coalition for the Homeless. The report stated that the City paid $3,000 every month for each apartment. TK: I find the figure a bit incredulous. They are unclear about their sourcing. I will have to make it clear with them. There were 57,089 people housed in the city shelter system according to the shelter daily census reports dated last Wednesday (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/downloads/pdf/dailyreport.pdf). Only a thousand people were moved to permanent housing last year according to the report by Coalition for the Homeless. TK: update the number before submission of final.
