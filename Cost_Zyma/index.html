					Implementing Project Reconnect is not about packing home all the homeless people coming into New York City from other states. It is about making a sound effort at repatriation such that they are not left stranded in the city   even if they have some place to go. That is what opinion-makers think to be the middle ground.
				</p>

				<p>
					They put forth Project Reconnect as a program that gives people the chance to go back home should they wish to – should they find themselves stuck in New York despite having opportunities elsewhere.
				</p>

				<p>
					The council member of district 33 Stephen Levin is among one of those taking that stance.
				</p>

				<p>
					After a story came out in the metro page of the New York Post in September 2014, bashing the program for sending the homeless off to other states, Levin issued a statement pointing out “no family or individual is forced to be part of this voluntary program and it is strictly for those who choose to receive help to return to a more stable life.”
				</p>

				<p>
					“Contrary to what the New York Post would have you believe, Project Reconnect is a common-sense program that helps homeless New Yorkers reconnect with loved ones. Under Project Reconnect, not only do homeless individuals get to make the voluntary choice to move in to a more stable living situation, but it also allows taxpayer dollars to be used more efficiently,” said Levin in his statement, circulated right after the story ran.
				</p>

				<p>
					Voluntary individuals like 27 year old Kevin Taylor.
				</p>

				<p>
					If all things go right – this may be Kevin's last week in New York City. The young homeless man is trying to move back to the place where he was born, where he grew up. He ran away to save himself from his father's abuse at the age of 17 and has been homeless for a decade now.
				</p>

				<p>
					Kevin spent the entire afternoon of his 27th birthday traveling up and down the N train from Times Square to Union Square. At each stop he waited until the doors closed shut and “Excuse me ladies and gentlemen, I won't take up too much of your time but I am trying to get to Montana.”
				</p>

				<p>
					“I have 60 dollars so far and need $37 more,” he said. The bus ticket cost $97.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the monthly statistics hosted by the Department of Homeless Services, around ten percent of all all the families with children taking shelter are not from New York. For adults the percentage is around 20 percent..
				</p>

				<p>
					According to the State of Homelessness report of 2015 produced by the Coalition for the Homeless, housing each family costs the DHS $37,047 a year. For housing adults the cost is just a little less around $28,609.
				</p>

				<p>
					Taking that into account, Project Reconnect has a maximum potential of saving the DHS up to $275 million a year. Only less than half a year has gone by, yet it can be seen from data obtained from the DHS that a total of approximately $210 million could have been saved.
				</p>

				<p>
					In fact the State of Homelessness 2015 report surmised that the average number of homeless people taking shelter in the city system each night has gone up by 13 percent. They reached the conclusion by comparing the shelter population of January 2014 with that of 2015.
				</p>
				<p>
					The report also said that only about a thousand people could be moved into permanent shelter last year, making the stark majority a recipient of the city's services for the homeless.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, the spokesperson from DHS put the average ticket price for sending a homeless person back home at $460 approximately Yet despite the clear benefits of the program, the DHS only repatriated 624 families out of the thousands that turn up that their shelters..
				</p>

				<p>
					Even Kevin got turned away when he tried to apply for the project, he said.”I used it once to go to Montana, but had no luck – and then I could not use it a second time,” said the homeless youth.
				</p>

				<p>
					Despite the scope of the project there is not any specific budget for this, said Doug Turetsky, the communication manager from the Independent Budget Office.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nowhere is there any mention of the program in the briefing paper on the preliminary budget of FY2015, presented to the city council for a hearing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nor is this a program nestling under the larger umbrella of the outreach and homelessness prevention schemes of the DHS, confirmed a DHS spokesperson Dover Brown.
				</p>

				<p>
					Experts agree that not all the people coming to New York City want to leave - but the need for a program like this remains undisputed.
