We settled on an idea quickly. Emilie suggested we cover Project Reconnect, a program run by the Department of Homeless Services that offers one-way, out-of-town transportation for homeless people in shelters. We all agreed.

We immediately saw that Project Reconnect had the makings of a good story. It is a contentious program, characterized by some as reunification and others expulsion. Better yet, it is a local issue with domestic impacts. And it had been largely under reported.

It was also apparent from day one that Project Reconnect would be difficult to cover. Dealing with city departments is challenging at the best of times. And homeless shelters also have a reputation for avoiding the press. 

Our concerns were realized. After two weeks, none of us had made any significant progress on uncovering data or locating reliable sources. The situation was so disheartening that we considered abandoning the story and had backup ideas on standby. 

Fortunately, we held the course thanks to some reassuring words from Professor McGregor and settled on New York Times: The UpShot as our target publication. It not only had the data driven focus that suited our program, but it also had the local connection our story needed.

With a target publication and clear focus, we divided up the story into four parts: background, process, cost and designation. This would prove to be one of our most fruitful decisions. It not only gave each of us a clear direction for reporting, it also meant that our four pieces would end up working together as a whole when we brought them together for the final product.

Reporting proved to be as, if not more, difficult than we expected. The Department of Homeless Services was not inclined to talk. It took weeks of speaking with a press person before to land even on-background quotes. The breakthrough came after finding a Columbia Journalism School alumni in the press office.

Our greatest breakthrough came from the Coalition of the Homeless. Howard nursed a contact who provided a great deal of insight into the program, and all of the data for Mark’s visualization. The contact also pointed us in the direction of other sources.

With this foundation, and some prompting from Professor McGregor, we took to homeless shelters and train stations to interview the main stakeholders of Project Reconnect—homeless New Yorkers. Zyma’s tireless work led to one man who had used the program, while the rest of us were turned away from shelters.

This absence of information proved to be telling. We wondered why had no one heard of the program? And used a lack of information as a reporting angle.

Our visualizations were chosen without too much difficulty. And we all agreed that one of our best achievements was having a variety of styles. Howard used a bar chart, Zyma created a column chart, Emilie drew up a process graph and Mark chose a map. And we are also proud that each visualization can also stand alone.

One of the most interesting parts of the visualization process was that we all found ourselves condensing information as we crafted our final products. Zyma took a graph with 50 circles and reduced it to a cohesive chart with six columns. Mark started off with an idea of using multiple points on a map to represent destinations and populations. His final product was much more simple. In the end, we all abandoned “boy-band” styling and focused on keeping our work clear.

Our programming came together quickly, too. This is partly due to The UpShot’s simple styling. But it also helped to break the build into manageable pieces. We started with the masthead and slowly worked our way down, adding bit by bit. Mark helped us build the first iteration with divs in HTML, and spent extra time converting the page to bootstrap. This may have added an extra step in programing, but it was worthwhile to take things one level at a time.

With our reporting done, and visualizations complete and the programing functional, we were ready to present. And once again, because we broke the story into background, process, cost and destination, it was easy to put together a clear presentation.

Overall, I think we are all happy with our work. And we are proud it ended up as well as it did, given our difficulty reporting in the beginning.
