Take Me Home: Insight into N.Y.C’s Homeless Relocation Program

Homelessness has been a source of vexation for New York’s government officials and citizens alike. Between 2013 and 2014, the total homeless population in N.Y.C increased by 6 percent, reaching a record high of more than 67,000 people, according to data from the 2014 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. With a city population of 8.4 million, according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics from 2013, this means roughly one in every 125 New Yorkers is currently sleeping in overpopulated shelters or on the street. 

By January 2015, the number of homeless in shelters has reached an all time high since the Great Depression, with more than 60,000 people each night, including more than 25,000 children, according to data from the Coalition for the Homeless. While N.Y.C Department of Homeless Services states that the number has decreased to around 57,000 by April, it is evident that more effective measures are necessary to combat the city’s homeless issue. 
	
However, there has been an assist program that claims to save money and reunite families, but it is often criticized as shortsighted: relocating homeless out of N.Y.C back to their hometown with one-way tickets. 

Project Reconnect, a city operated assist program under the Department of Homeless Service (DHS), provides one-way travel assistance to homeless by train, bus or air, if the applicants proved to have strong connections and means to support themselves outside of N.Y.C, according to the program’s official brochure. 

Since 2007, the government has subsidized trips from the Carolinas to the Caribbean’s, some even to Europe or Africa. DHS’s spokesman Christopher Miller told the New York Post that the program helps homeless New Yorkers reunite with their loved ones and find other stable housing and employment options. 

New York City Council Member Stephen Levin also supported Project Reconnect. “Under Project Reconnect, not only do homeless individuals get to make the voluntary choice to move in to a more stable living situation, but it also allows taxpayer dollars to be used more efficiently,” said Levin in a statement on tumblr. “No family or individual is forced to be part of this voluntary program and it is strictly for those who choose to receive help to return to a more stable life.”
	
However, Arnold S.Cohen, the president of Partnership for the Homeless, an advocacy group in New York, was skeptical about the program’s effect. “The city is engaged in cosmetics,” said Cohen in New York Times. “What we’re doing is passing the problem of homelessness to another city.”
	
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg first introduced Project Reconnect in 2007. The program relocated 550 families to other states and even overseas to Paris and Puerto Rico. Today, the average one-way ticket cost can range from $300 to $500 for each individual depending on the destination, which is still lower than the $50 per person or $100 per family daily shelter fee, said Gabriela Requena, policy analyst for Coalition for the Homeless. “It is more expensive to have a client in the shelter system than to provide them with the one-way ticket,” said Requena. 
	
The program makes great economic sense and it has been pervasive around the United States, said Sam Dodger Deputy Director for Policy in San Francisco City Hall. In 2009, more a dozen homeless left Lancaster, California, through the Opportunity Bus Pass program. Its former mayor R.Rex Parris even contributed $10,000 to the bus program, LA Times reported. 
	
San Francisco’s Homeward Bound program has more specific rules. In addition to having a strong connection outside of city, the applicants have to be medically stable to travel unassisted and abstain from alcohol or using other substance, before they get their bus ticket from the Human Services Agency, according to the program’s official website. Personal hygiene also has to be at an acceptable level to travel. Shower and clothing facilities are available before entering the transportation. 
	
Two new cities recently joined the homeless relocation momentum. In June 2013, the Metro Council of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has approved a measure to bus homeless to their destination. In the budget document, the program is called Homeless Outreach Prevention Efforts (HOPE). The initial budget for the program was around $5000. With average bus ticket around $150 per person, roughly 30 out of the city’s estimated 800 homeless would get the ticket, according to the Advocate. Given Baton Rouge’s small city size (80 square miles, Brooklyn: 96 square miles), it is reasonable to practice the program on a smaller scale. However, the state of Hawaii, though small in geography, has implemented stronger effort in its relocation program.

Estimated 17,000 homeless in the state, Hawaii planted to devote $100,000 in the “Return to Home” program starting 2013 to fund airplanes and cruise ships for anyone who meets the requirements, according to Honolulu Civil Beats. The Department of Human Services is responsible for screening the candidates and providing the tickets. Apart from being mentally healthy, clean, and support at destination, applicants must act voluntarily and only allowed to use the service once. By November 2014, 120 homeless in Waikiki are scheduled to return back to mainland, according to the Institute for Human Services, a non-profit social service agency in Hawaii. 

However, Waikiki’s homeless population makeup is different comparing to other U.S. cities. Many Waikiki homeless are people who either made a choice to become homeless or became homeless shortly after arriving in Hawaii, Kimo Carvalho, development and community relations manager for IHS, told Civil Beats. Most homeless in N.Y.C shelters are native families with children, many of which are due to eviction, domestic abuse, unemployment or other social reasons, said Requena. 

As a result, homeless relocation programs such as Project Reconnect provides an alternative for eligible applicants currently in the shelter system to look for opportunities elsewhere. “The program is for their wellbeing,” said Requena. “If they don’t want to go anywhere, they don’t have to. People in New York City have the right to shelter and that needs to be respected.”
