				Homelessness has been a source of vexation for New York City's government officials and citizens alike. 
				</p><p>
				Between 2013 and 2014, the total homeless population in N.Y.C increased by 6 percent, reaching a record high of more than 67,000 people, according to data from the 2014 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. 
				</p><p>
				By January 2015, the number of homeless in shelters has reached an all time high since the Great Depression, with more than 60,000 people each night, including more than 25,000 children, according to data from the Coalition for the Homeless. 
				</p><p>
				With a city population of 8.4 million, according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics from 2013, this means roughly one in every 125 New Yorkers is currently sleeping in overpopulated shelters or on the street.
				</p><p>
				While N.Y.C Department of Homeless Services states that the number of homeless has decreased to around 57,000 by April, it is evident that more effective measures are necessary to combat the city's homeless issue. 
				</p><p>
				Project Reconnect, a city operated assist program under the Department of Homeless Service (DHS), provides one-way travel assistance to homeless by train, bus or air, if the applicants proved to have strong connections and means to support themselves outside of N.Y.C, according to the program's official brochure. 
				</p><p>
				Since 2007, the government has subsidized trips from the Carolinas to the Caribbean's, some even to Europe or Africa. 
				</p><p>
				DHS's spokesman Christopher Miller told the New York Post in 2014 that the program helped homeless New Yorkers reunite with their loved ones and find other stable housing and employment options. 
				</p><p>
				New York City Council Member Stephen Levin also supported Project Reconnect. "Under Project Reconnect, not only do homeless individuals get to make the voluntary choice to move in to a more stable living situation, but it also allows taxpayer dollars to be used more efficiently," said Levin in a public statement in 2014. "No family or individual is forced to be part of this voluntary program and it is strictly for those who choose to receive help to return to a more stable life."
				</p><p>
				However, Saskia Sassen, Columbia sociology professor, was skeptical about the program's intent. "It makes visible that we are indeed expelling from our social space more and more people," she said in an email interview. "We are witnesses to the employment of policies that generate massive expulsions and it is not clear what the alternatives for survival are for these expelled. "
				</p><p>
				Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg first introduced Project Reconnect in 2007. The program relocated 550 families to other states and even overseas to Paris and Puerto Rico. Today, the average one-way ticket cost can range from $300 to $500 for individuals depending on the destination, which is still lower than the $50 per person or $100 per family daily shelter fee, said Gabriela Sandoval Requena, policy analyst for Coalition for the Homeless. 
				</p><p>
				"It is more expensive to have a client in the shelter system than to provide them with the one-way ticket," said Requena. 
				</p><p>
				The economic rational is a strong argument in favor of Project Reconnects. From coast to coast, other cities have implemented similar programs to combat homelessness. 
				</p><p>
				Sam Dodge, Deputy Director for Policy in San Francisco City Hall, agreed the price of ticket is cheap compared to permanent supportive housing or even the cost of someone living on the streets. "So economically, it makes tons of sense," he said. "Because of the economics of the situation, it's a pervasive program around the United States." 
				</p><p>
				San Francisco's Homeward Bound program has more specific rules. In addition to having a strong connection outside of city, the applicants have to be medically stable to travel unassisted and abstain from alcohol or using other substance, before they get their bus ticket from the Human Services Agency, according to the program's official website. Personal hygiene also has to be at an acceptable level to travel. Shower and clothing facilities are available before entering the transportation. 
				</p><p>
				"The program is a once-in-a-lifetime program," said Dodge. "Over the last eight to nine years, they [the program] have connected almost 9,000 families, and we have had 25 people come back. "
				</p><p>
				Two new cities recently joined the homeless relocation momentum. 
				</p><p>
				In June 2013, the Metro Council of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has approved a program to bus homeless to their destination: Homeless Outreach Prevention Efforts (HOPE). The initial budget for the program was around $5000, with average bus ticket ranging from $75 to $150 per person, according to the city's 2013 Midyear Supplemental Budget. 
				</p><p>
				Given Baton Rouge's small city size (80 square miles, Brooklyn: 96 square miles), it is reasonable to practice the program on a smaller scale. However, the state of Hawaii, though small in geography, has implemented stronger effort in its relocation program. 
				</p><p>
				Estimated 17,000 homeless in the state, Hawaii planted to devote $100,000 in the "Return to Home" program starting 2013 to fund airplanes and cruise ships for anyone who meets the requirements, according to Honolulu Civil Beats, a public affairs news outlet in Hawaii. The Department of Human Services is responsible for screening the candidates and providing the tickets. 
				</p><p>
				By November 2014, 120 homeless in Waikiki are scheduled to return back to mainland, according to the Institute for Human Services, a non-profit social service agency in Hawaii. 
				</p><p>
				In theory, Homeless relocation programs such as Project Reconnect provides an alternative for eligible applicants currently in the shelter system to pursue opportunities elsewhere. In practice, only a handful of people apply because the majority of homeless people are locals. 
				</p><p>
				Moreover, the limitation that homeless can only use the program once raises the question of intention. Sassen said the homeless relocation program is ethically dubious. "I think the one-way ticket of the city is yet another instance of expulsions," said Sassen. "They [the city] do not want to see those people again." 
				</p><p>
				In response to critics of the program, Requena emphasized the program is voluntary. "The program is for their wellbeing," she said. "If they don't want to go anywhere, they don't have to. People in New York City have the right to shelter and that needs to be respected."
